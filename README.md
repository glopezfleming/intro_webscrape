Welcome to my code sample 1! This is some java code that uses the Jsoup library to scrape information off the linked URL:
https://www.thefader.com/2016/02/23/global-artists-you-need-to-know

The info from this website I pulled included the artist name, hometown, bio, and photo URL. I then used this infromation to create a list of Artist objects containing this information.
